- Run `pnpm install` to install the dependencies.
- Run `pnpm dev` to compile the extension and watch for changes.  
- Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
- Run your command from the command palette by pressing (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) and typing `Hello World`.
- Set breakpoints in your code inside `src/extension.ts` to debug your extension.
